# Info for Nerds

Hey hows it going, if you're reading this I assume you're interested in my work.  
Feel free to reach out to me directly using the contact info on my resume!

[Repo for this site](https://github.com/pmcopeland/portfolio)

This site was built in Vue3  
The page animations are handled by [vue-fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/vue-fullpage/) by √Ålvaro Trigo.  
[Vue-Mq](https://vue3-mq.info/) was used for responsive design.

The chromatic effect is triggered by users loading/changing the page. It utilizes a simple css animation on three separate divs (one for each color channel).
